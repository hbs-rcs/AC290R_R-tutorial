[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org)â€™s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for those interested in working with global facts data in R.

This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. These lessons can be taught in one-half day. They start with some basic information about the RStudio interface & R syntax, move through how to find information and get help, read and write data files in multiple formats and inspect the results, the basics of data frames and how to manipulate, aggregate, and calculate summary statistics, and an introduction to plotting. We close with some discussion on base R and gotchas, including how to handle missing data and the benefits of factors.


## Requirements

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged
to use their own computers to ensure the proper setup of tools for an
efficient workflow.  *These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the
skills or tools*, but working through this lesson requires working
copies of the software described below.  To most effectively use these
materials, please make sure to install everything *before* working
through this lesson.

We will be using [this Etherpad](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/hbs_doctoral_2017) for sharing notes.

You can also read thru a [log of the workshop session R commands](/R_Intro-gapminder/data/lesson_transcript.R).  

## Data

Files for the lesson are available and can be downloaded manually here:

* [Continents data](/R_Intro-gapminder/data/continents.RDA) file (downsampled)
* [GapMinder Five Year](/R_Intro-gapminder/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv) data

However, we will download them directly from R during the lessons as we need them.


## Installation

Greetings! We are happy that you are going to join us for our half-day training on R. As you probably know, R (https://www.r-project.org/) is a free software environment and program language, gaining significant popularity, that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we will use RStudio. NOTE that you must install both R and RStudio, and it is essential that you have these pre-installed so that we can start the workshop on time.
 
Mac OS X
Install R by downloading and running [this .pkg file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the [RStudio Desktop IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
 
Windows
Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install the [RStudio Desktop IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
 
Linux
You can download the binary files for your distribution from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install R`). Also, please install the [RStudio Desktop IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
 
Success?
After both installations, please launch RStudio. If you were successful with the installations, you should see a window similar to this:

![](fig/rstudio_successful_install.png)

(Please note that the version of R reported may be newer). If you are having any difficulties with the installations or your RStudio screen does not look like this one, please contact [research@hbs.edu](mailto:research@hbs.edu); or stop by the training room at 8:30 am the morning of our workshop.

Finally, we'd like you to install the 'tidyverse' suite of tools. Please enter the command `install.packages('tidyverse')` at the command prompt and press Enter. A number of messages will scroll by, and there will be a long minute or two pause where nothing appears to happen (but the installation is actually occurring). At last, the output parade should end with a message like `The downloaded source/binary packages are in...`. If not, again, please stop by the training room early.
