### Why R?

R is a free, open-source programming/scripting language, inspired by the programming language S. It can do most things that any
programming language can do, but it was designed for data analysis and statistics,
which is why we teach it. It has a huge user-community and is highly extensible, 
with over 7,000 packages that build extra functionality at the official 
Comprehensive R Archive Network. For almost anything you want to do, there is an R package to help.

### Why RStudio?

RStudio is an IDE (integrated development environment) which we use to manage 
and execute R code. It is also free and open-source, it works on all platforms 
(e.g. you can interface to Amazon Web Services using RStudio), and it integrates version 
control and project management.

### Why script?

* Power
* Flexibility
* Editability: Error fixing, tweaks
* Traceability: Return and know what was done
* Reproducability: Cornerstone of science
* Communication: No ambiguity
    + Literate programming, knitr


## Introduction to RStudio

Open RStudio: 3 panels:

- The interactive R console (entire left)
- Workspace/History (tabbed in upper right)
- Files/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right)

### Workflow within Rstudio

Console vs. script

1. Console
    - The R console is where all of your code gets run. This console in RStudio is the
same as the one you would get if you just typed in `R` in your command line.
    - When you start RStudio, you'll see a bunch of information, followed by 
a ">" and a blinking cursor. This is a "Read, evaluate, print loop": you 
type in commands, R executes them and returns a result.
    - *Demo R-as-calculator in console*
    - History is saved, but this is laborsome
1. Script
    - Preserve work in a plain-text file (with .R extension)
    - *Create new R script*
    - Fourth RStudio panel.
    - Command/ctrl-enter to push current line
    - Mixes interactivity and preservation
    - Save just text and get same results
    - Building preservable flow of operations
    

> #### Tip: Pushing to the interactive R console {.callout}
> To run the current line click on the `Run` button just above the file pane. 
> Or use the short cut which can be seen by hovering the mouse over the button.
>
> To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`. 
>
> Select-all and `Run` -- moving toward a model where we run whole script.


## Organizing yourself and your work

The scientific process is naturally incremental, and many projects
start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
eventually everything is a bit mixed together.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Managing your projects in a reproducible fashion doesn't just make your science reproducible, it makes your life easier.</p>&mdash; Vince Buffalo (@vsbuffalo) <a href="https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo/status/323638476153167872">April 15, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

![](fig/bad_layout.png)

There are many reasons why we should *ALWAYS* avoid this:

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is
the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find
things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code
that has been used to generate it;

A good project layout will ultimately make your life easier:

* It will help ensure the integrity of your data;
* It makes it simpler to share your code with someone else
(a lab-mate, collaborator, or supervisor);
* It allows you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* It makes it easier to pick the project back up after a break.

### A possible solution

Fortunately, there are tools and packages which can help you manage your work effectively.

One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is its project management
functionality. We'll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible
project.


> #### Challenge -- Creating a Project {.challenge}
>
> We're going to create a new project in RStudio:
>
> 1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
> 2. Click "New Directory".
> 3. Click "Empty Project".
> 4. Type a descriptive directory name: This is the title of yoru project, e.g. "DC_Workshop".
> 5. Store the new directory in a sensable place in your computer's organizational scheme.
> 6. Click "Create Project".
>

Now when we start R in this project directory, or open this project with RStudio,
all of our work on this project will be entirely self-contained in this directory.

### Best practices for project organisation

Although there is no "best" way to lay out a project, there are some general
principles to adhere to that will make project management easier:

#### Treat raw data as read only

This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is
typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them
interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never
sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection.
It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as "read-only".

#### Treat generated output as disposable

Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should
all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.

There are lots of different was to manage this output. I find it useful to
have an output folder with different sub-directories for each separate
analysis. This makes it easier later, as many of my analyses are exploratory
and don't end up being used in the final project, and some of the analyses
get shared between projects.

#### Separate function definition and application

The most effective way I find to work in R, is to play around in the interactive
session, then copy commands across to a script file when I'm sure they work and
do what I want. You can also save all the commands you've entered using the
`history` command, but I don't find it useful because when I'm typing its 90%
trial and error.

When your project is new and shiny, the script file usually contains many lines
of directly executed code. As it matures, reusable chunks get pulled into their
own functions. It's a good idea to separate these into separate folders; one
to store useful functions that you'll reuse across analyses and projects, and
one to store the analysis scripts.

#### A possible organization scheme

- data
- code
- results
- papers


#### Download gapminder data to the data directory

Now we will create a good directory structure and save the data file in the `data/` directory.

> #### Challenge -- Project Organization {.challenge}

> 1. In your project directory, either using the Project tab of RStudio or your OS' file system, create the following directories:

> - code
> - results
> - papers
> 1. Files with the .RDA extension are R-Data files. Right-click on [this link](./data/continents.RDA) to "save file as ..."
> 1. Save the `continents.RDA` file to the `data/` directory in your project
> 2. Save [gapminder-FiveYearData.csv](./data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv) to the `data/` directory in your project
>
> We will load and inspect this dataset in the next section.


### Seeking help

#### I know the name of the function I want to use, but I'm not sure how to use it

If you need help with a specific function, let's say `barplot()`, you can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?barplot
```

Each help-file contains the following components.

- *Description*: An extended description of what the function does.
- *Usage*: The arguments of the function and their default values.
- *Arguments*: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting.
- *Details*: Any important details to be aware of.
- *Value*: The data the function returns.
- *See Also*: Any related functions you might find useful.
- *Examples*: Some examples for how to use the function.



If you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
args(lm)
```

If the function is part of a package that is installed on your computer but
don't remember which one, you can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
??geom_point
```

#### I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don't know which one...

If you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use
`help.search()` (but only looks through the installed packages):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help.search("kruskal")
```

If you can't find what you are looking for, you can use the
[rdocumention.org](http://www.rdocumentation.org) website that search through
the help files across all packages available.

#### I am stuck... I get an error message that I don't understand

Start by googling the error message. However, this doesn't always work very well
because often, package developers rely on the error catching provided by R. You
end up with general error messages that might not be very helpful to diagnose a
problem (e.g. "subscript out of bounds").

However, you should check stackoverflow. Search using the `[r]` tag. Most
questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right
words in the search to find the answers:
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

The [Introduction to R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf) can
also be dense for people with little programming experience but it is a good
place to understand the underpinnings of the R language.

The [R FAQ](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html) is dense and technical
but it is full of useful information.

### Asking for help

The key to get help from someone is for them to grasp your problem rapidly. You
should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be.

* Try to use the correct words to describe your problem.
* Try to reduce what doesn't work to a simple reproducible example.
* **always include the output of `sessionInfo()`**

*Try to use the correct words to describe your problem.* For instance, a package
is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand what you meant,
but others have really strong feelings about the difference in meaning. The key
point is that it can make things confusing for people trying to help you. Be as
precise as possible when describing your problem

*Try to reduce what doesn't work to a simple reproducible example.* If you can 
reproduce the problem using a very small `data.frame`
instead of your 50,000 rows and 10,000 columns one, provide the small one with
the description of your problem.

For helpful info on sharing data objects with someone else, see 
[this Asking For Help section](https://github.com/fasrc/AC290R_R-tutorial/blob/gh-pages/00-before-we-start.Rmd#asking-for-help)
from another R tutorial.


*Always include the output of `sessionInfo()`.*
This provides critical information about your platform, the versions of R and
the packages that you are using, and other information that can be very helpful
to understand your problem.

```{r, results='show'}
sessionInfo()
```

### Where to ask for help?

* Your friendly colleagues: if you know someone with more experience than you,
  they might be able and willing to help you.
  
* Google: looking for the specific error message can be helpful. But don't use
  text that is *way* too specific. Most likely, search results will lead you to...
  
* Stackoverlow: if your question hasn't been answered before and is well
  crafted, chances are you will get an answer in less than 5 min.
  
* The [R-help](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help): it is read by a
  lot of people (including most of the R core team), a lot of people post to it,
  but the tone can be pretty dry, and it is not always very welcoming to new
  users. If your question is valid, you are likely to get an answer very fast
  but don't expect that it will come with smiley faces. Also, here more than
  everywhere else, be sure to use correct vocabulary (otherwise you might get an
  answer pointing to the misuse of your words rather than answering your
  question). You will also have more success if your question is about a base
  function rather than a specific package.
  
* If your question is about a specific package, see if there is a mailing list
  for it. Usually it's included in the DESCRIPTION file of the package that can
  be accessed using `packageDescription("name-of-package")`. You may also want
  to try to email the author of the package directly.
  
* There are also some topic-specific mailing lists (GIS, phylogenetics, etc...),
  the complete list is [here](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html).
