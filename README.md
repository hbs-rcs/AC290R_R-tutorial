# Modifying this Tutorial

To update this tutorial you will need:

1.  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
    [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) to convert markdown
    files to html. It can also be used to serve the html files
    locally.

To deploy the tutorial to GitHub Pages use

    make deploy
    
This uses [git-directory-deploy][gdd] under the hood.
